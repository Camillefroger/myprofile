						<h2>I love dancing</h2>
						<p>
						I started dancing when I was very young, taking ballet for 7 years, then in search of greater creativity and expression I turned to modern jazz dance. It's a passion of mine that gives me an intense sense of well-being and allows me to escape from my everyday life.

						<h2>I like travelling</h2>
						<p>
							Travelling is one of the passions I've developed at the heart of my life, thanks in particular to my parents who encouraged me to travel: by their side but also on my own. I love discovering new landscapes, but above all learning more about the world's cultures by exchanging ideas with the people who populate our entire planet.
						</br> </br>Here is a video of the best places to visit in China!
